# Model-World

This model ('DIDX_model_built') is an adaptation of the overwash model described in:

Lazarus ED, Armstrong S (2015) Self-organized pattern formation in coastal barrier washover deposits, Geology 43(4), 363â€“366.

Here, this adaptation simulates washover deposition into a generic built environment. The model is written in MATLAB, and presently configured for overwash flow through a single barrier breach.
